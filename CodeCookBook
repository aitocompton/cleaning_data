Feature Selection 
=================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years denoted as "activity".

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist denoted as "subject".




The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signal time_accelerometer_XYZ and time_gyroscope_XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (time_body_accelerometer_XYZ and time_gravity_accelerometer_XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (time_body_accelerometer_jerk_XYZ and time_body_ gyroscope_jerk_XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (time_body_accelerometer_magnitude, time_gravity_accelerometer_magnitude, time_body_ accelerometer_jerk_magnitude, time_body_gyroscope_magnitude, time_body_gyroscope_jerk_magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency_body_accelerometer_XYZ, frequency_body_accelerometer_jerk_XYZ, frequency_body_gyroscope_XYZ, frequency_body_accelerometer_jerk_magnitude, frequency_body_gyroscope_magnitude, frequency_body_gyroscope_jerk_magnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'_XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value denoted as "mean".
